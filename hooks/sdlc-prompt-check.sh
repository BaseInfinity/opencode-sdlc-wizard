SDLC BASELINE:
1. TodoWrite FIRST (plan tasks before coding)
2. STATE CONFIDENCE: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
3. LOW confidence? ASK USER before proceeding
4. FAILED 2x? STOP and ASK USER
5. ALL TESTS MUST PASS BEFORE COMMIT - NO EXCEPTIONS

AUTO-INVOKE SKILL (Claude MUST do this FIRST):
- implement/fix/refactor/feature/bug/build/test/TDD/release/publish/deploy → Invoke: Skill tool, skill="sdlc"
- DON'T invoke for: questions, explanations, reading/exploring code, simple queries
- DON'T wait for user to type /sdlc - AUTO-INVOKE based on task type

Workflow phases:
1. Plan Mode (research) → Present approach + confidence
2. Transition (update docs) → Request /compact
3. Implementation (TDD after compact)
4. SELF-REVIEW (/code-review) → BEFORE presenting to user
